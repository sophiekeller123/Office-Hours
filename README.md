5. A short description of your app (its purpose and features)
This app allows users to create an account, add classes, and view given office hours available for either the current day, or the entire week. 
Users can select a given class and see all the hours for that class specifically. 

6. A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements (iOS / Backend)
The layout is accomplished with NSLayoutConstraint.
There are UICollectionViews utilyzed to portray office hours as well as classes in multiple views of the app.
A UITabBarController is used to navigate between view controllers and a UINavigationController originally navigates to that UITabBarController.
The application communicates with backend API also located in this repository.
